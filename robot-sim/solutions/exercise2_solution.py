Exercise 2 python script

Put the main code after the definition of the functions. The code should make the robot grab the closest marker (token)
Steps to be performed:
1 - call the function find_token() to retrieve the distance and the angle between the robot and the closest marker
2 - drive the robot towards the marker. If the distance between the robot and the marker is less than d_th
     meters, the robot can grab the marker, by using the method grab() of the class Robot. Otherwise, the 
     robot should be driven toward the token. The robot is a non-holonomic robot, so you should control the 
     angle, by calling the method turn, if rot_y is greater then a_th or lower then -a_th (check the sign!).
     On the contrary, if -a_th < rot_y < a_th, you can use the method drive to move the robot forward.
3 - after you grab the marker, you can exit the program (function exit()).

   When done, run with:
